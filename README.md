Educational app available in the App Store in English and German
Choose a historical scenario, set your desired run time, and experience the events of history in your own time.
I focused on the functionality of the app, developing complex data models and methods to display a series of timed events within the user's selected timeframe.
More info and screenshots will be posted here soon!
