# TimeTranslator
Educational app available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/time-translator/id1552304730) in English and German.
Choose a historical scenario, set your desired run time, and experience the events of history in your own time.

I collaborated with @Zachthac to build TimeTranslator for our clients, who have been dreaming of this app for two years.
I focused on the functionality of the app, developing complex data models and methods to display a series of timed events within the user's selected timeframe.

More info will be posted here soon!
